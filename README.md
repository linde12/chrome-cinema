# chrome-cinema

A small plugin for chrome which i personally use to have multiple videos up at the same time in a windowed fullscreen mode (to maximize video area)

I know that it can require a page reload on some youtube videos (because there is some JS magic behind the scenes on youtube) but other than that
it has worked fine on the sites i've tested. If you have any issues please place an issue.

# Usage

Simply CTRL+Click any HTML5 video element to enter or exit fullscreen.
